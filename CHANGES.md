### Wed Sep 25 2013 - Interim Release (ver 1.02)
* Fixed handling of callback properties so that they are set to nil after execution in a thread-safe manner.
* Added #define kYMSCBVersionNumber

### Sat Sep 18 2013 - iOS7 Release (ver 1.0)
* Updated codebase to support all iOS7 changes to the CoreBluetooth API.

* #73 - Fix declaration of block properties to copy

### Tue Jul 16 2013 - Interim Release (ver 0.945)
* Bugfix #61 - Change all delegate implementations so that the callback is performed on the main thread.

### Sat Jul 6 2013 - Interim Release (ver 0.944)
* Bugfix #69 - Reload peripheralsTableView when dismissing SensorTag view controller
* Bugfix #68 - Handle CoreBluetooth XPC reset
* Issue #32 - Added interim icon design by Wayne Dahlberg

### Mon Jun 24 2013 - Interim Release (ver 0.943)
* Initial work on beautifying Deanna app (Issue #62) based on graphic design work by [Wayne Dahlberg](http://waynedahlberg.com).
* Fixes to updates of RSSI values via scanning or by connection.

### Sat Jun 22 2013 - Interim Release (ver 0.942)
* Reimplemented background thread UI updates to use GCD `dispatch_async()` instead of `performSelectorOnMainThread:` (Issue #61).
* Updated documentation.

### Wed Jun 19 2013 - Interim Release (ver 0.941)
* Support for background thread operation of BLE transactions (Issues #57, #58, #59)

Prior releases ran all BLE transactions off the main UI thread. For a small number of BLE devices (< 5), performance degradation was neglible. However, in an environment with many devices (> 30), support for background operation that does not block the main UI is necessary. Changes so that messages sent to the delegate for `YMSCBCentralManager` and `YMSCBPeripheral` are executed in the main thread.

Similarly, any change to a property of a subclass of `YMSCBService` should be executed in the main thread so that it can be properly key-value observed (KVO) by any UI components.

* API Change: Removed RSSI auto-update functionality from YmsCoreBluetooth.

This directly attributed with background thread operation of BLE transactions. Prior code, if run using a background thread, would not correctly schedule a read of the RSSI value of a peripheral. It is now the responsibility of an application using YmsCoreBluetooth to invoke `readRSSI` and handle the response to update the UI properly.

* Update of Deanna and DeannaMac to support background thread BLE transactions.

#### API Changes

* `[YMSCBPeripheral initWithPeripheral:central:baseHi:baseLo:updateRSSI:]` is obsolete.<br/>Replacing this call is `[YMSCBPeripheral initWithPeripheral:central:baseHi:baseLo:]`

* `[YMSCBPeripheral updateRSSI]` is obsolete.

* `[YMSCBCentralManager initWithKnownPeripheralNames:queue:]` is obsolete.<br/>Replacing this call is `[YMSCBCentralManager initWithKnownPeripheralNames:queue:delegate:]`

* `[YMSCBCentralManager initWithKnownPeripheralNames:queue:useStoredPeripherals:]` is obsolete.<br/>Replacing this call is `[YMSCBCentralManager initWithKnownPeripheralNames:queue:userStoredPeripherals:delegate:]`



### Mon Jun 3 2013 - Disco Release (ver 0.94)
* Issue #9 - OS X Support

YmsCoreBluetooth now supports OS X! Includes app target DeannaMac which replicates functionality found in Deanna for iOS.

Tested Mac Environment:

* OS X 10.8.3
* Cirago Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter
* iMac 27 Mid-2010

### Sun May 26 2013 - Rare Groove Release (ver 0.93)
* Issue #47 - rename YMSCBAppService to YMSCBCentralManager. 
  Associated changes include:
    - renaming DEAAppService to DEACentralManager
	- rename variable cbAppService to centralManager

* API change to fully embrace ObjectiveC block-based callbacks.
* API change to map BLE operations to data object hierarchy.

**API 0.93 is a BIG CHANGE.** It is largely a rethink of YmsCoreBluetooth to support the pattern for hierarchical block-based operations. This will very much *break code* written for prior releases of YmsCoreBluetooth. That said, the changes should be fairly comprehensible and address the following points going forward:

* Improved understanding of API behavior: prior releases had too much implicit behavior ("magic") which made involuntary decisions for the developer using the API. Using blocks gives the developer a clearer and more structured view of the BLE transactions to be made.
* With the pattern for hierarchical block-based operations in place, a more structured way to add new API features. Like Winter, characteristic descriptors are coming.

### Sun May 12 2013 - Moombahton Release (ver 0.92)
* Block-based callbacks for central manager scanning, peripheral connection, and peripheral retrieval are now supported.
* Watchdog timeout for unanswered peripheral connection requests are now supported.
* Significant API changes to YMSCBCentralManager and YMSCBPeripheral detailed below.

    * Separation of peripheral discovery by scanning from peripheral retrieval via stored UUID.
    * Removed `NSNotification` messages to use `CBCentralManagerDelegate` methods instead.
* Reorganized physical file directory structure to match that of Xcode project group structure.
* Added RSSI display to both peripheral screen and SensorTag screen.
* Added connect button per peripherals discovered.
* Initial support for multiple SensorTags. (This has not yet been tested, due to the fact that I have only 1 SensorTag to test.)

### Sun Mar 3 2013
* First stable release.
* Support for communication with all sensors/services on a SensorTag.
* Initial documentation for YmsCoreBluetooth API and Deanna source code.
